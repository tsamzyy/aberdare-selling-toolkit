# Valuation Checklist (Aberdare / CF44)

## B) Location factors (be honest)
- [ ] What’s the exact area? (e.g., Aberdare town, Cwmbach, Penywaun, Trecynon, etc.)
- [ ] Road position: main road / quiet street / cul-de-sac
- [ ] Walkability: schools / shops / transport nearby
- [ ] Views / outlook: open view / overlooked / rear lane

## C) Condition and “buyer friction” checks

- [ ] Boiler age (over ~10–12 years)

- [ ] Insulation and heating efficiency
- [ ] Any structural cracks (or movement history)
- [ ] Shared access / rights of way / rear lane arrangements
- [ ] Loft conversions or extensions without paperwork

## D) Upgrades that usually help value (and speed)
- [ ] Fresh paint in light neutral tones
- [ ] Deep clean, carpets cleaned, decluttered rooms
- [ ] Tidy entrance, door, handles, house number visible
- [ ] Garden trimmed, bins hidden, paths clear
- [ ] Fix small snags: dripping taps, loose handles, broken sockets
- [ ] Good lighting (bright bulbs) and clean windows

## E) Evidence to gather (before the valuation)
- [ ] List of improvements + rough dates (kitchen/bathroom, boiler, roof, windows)
- [ ] Guarantees/warranties (boiler, roof work, damp proofing)
- [ ] FENSA/Building Regs certificates (if applicable)
- [ ] Leasehold info (ground rent/service charge/management company details)
- [ ] Any planning permissions / completion certificates
- [ ] Any boundary notes or agreements

## F) Comparing the valuation you’re given
For each agent, ask and note:
- [ ] What sold comparables are you basing this on? (addresses + sold prices + dates)
- [ ] What is the marketing price vs expected sale price?
- [ ] What price would you choose for a 2–3 week “best first impression” launch?
- [ ] What’s the plan if we get low viewings in 10–14 days?
- [ ] How will you handle feedback and repositioning?
- [ ] What buyer demand are you seeing right now for this type of home?

## G) Pricing strategy (simple rules that work)
- [ ] Price for the buyer pool you want, not the number you wish for
- [ ] If competing listings are stronger, price must reflect that
- [ ] If your home is “move-in ready”, you can usually push slightly higher
- [ ] If condition is dated, the price must do the heavy lifting

## H) Final decision
- [ ] Choose the price that attracts viewings fast
- [ ] Agree review points: day 10 and day 21
- [ ] Confirm your minimum acceptable offer range privately
