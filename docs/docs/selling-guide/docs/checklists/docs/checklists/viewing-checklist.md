# Viewing Checklist (Aberdare / CF44)

Your goal is simple: make it feel easy to live here, and remove reasons to hesitate.

## A) 24–48 hours before viewings
- [ ] Declutter surfaces (kitchen/bathroom especially)
- [ ] Put away laundry, toys, excess toiletries
- [ ] Empty bins, clean sink, wipe down counters
- [ ] Vacuum, mop, and remove pet hair
- [ ] Make beds, straighten cushions, tidy chairs
- [ ] Clear hallway/landing (first impressions)
- [ ] Clean windows and mirrors
- [ ] Tidy garden/yard, sweep steps/path
- [ ] Move cars if they block access or make parking look tight

## B) Quick “buyer psychology” wins
- [ ] Bright bulbs in key rooms (warm white)
- [ ] Curtains/blinds open for light
- [ ] Neutral smell (air out for 15–20 minutes)
- [ ] No strong cooking smells before viewings
- [ ] Heating set comfortable in winter (don’t let it feel cold)
- [ ] Music/TV off (quiet, calm atmosphere)

## C) Safety and access
- [ ] Keys ready, locks working smoothly
- [ ] Ensure pets are secured (or taken out)
- [ ] Hide valuables and personal documents
- [ ] Clear trip hazards (wires, rugs, clutter on stairs)
- [ ] Replace any missing smoke alarm batteries if chirping

## D) The 10-minute “power tidy” before they arrive
- [ ] Open windows briefly, then close
- [ ] Quick wipe in bathroom
- [ ] Final sweep: hallway + kitchen + living room
- [ ] Put fresh hand towel out
- [ ] Turn on a couple of lamps if light is low

## E) During the viewing (what to do)
- [ ] Leave the agent to do the talking where possible
- [ ] Be friendly, but not over-explain
- [ ] If asked tough questions, answer honestly and briefly
- [ ] Let them imagine living there (avoid hovering)

## F) Questions buyers often ask (prep answers)
- [ ] What are the running costs like? (energy bills / council tax band)
- [ ] How’s the parking day-to-day?
- [ ] Any neighbours/shared access arrangements?
- [ ] Any work done: boiler/windows/roof? Paperwork available?
- [ ] Reason for moving and ideal timescale?

## G) After each viewing
- [ ] Ask for feedback within 24 hours
- [ ] Note what they liked and what they hesitated on
- [ ] If the same issue repeats (price/condition), act quickly
