# Fall-Through Prevention Checklist (Aberdare / CF44)

Sales fall through because of delays, poor communication, finance issues, survey shocks, or chain problems. This checklist reduces all of those.

## A) Before you even list
- [ ] ID and proof of address ready (for agent + solicitor)
- [ ] Decide where you’re going (or your plan if renting/with family)
- [ ] Choose a solicitor early (don’t wait for an offer)
- [ ] Gather key documents:
  - [ ] EPC (or book it)
  - [ ] FENSA / building regs certificates (if relevant)
  - [ ] Warranties/guarantees (boiler, roof work, damp proofing)
  - [ ] Leasehold pack info (if applicable)
  - [ ] Any planning permissions / completion certificates

## B) When you accept an offer (first 72 hours)
- [ ] Confirm buyer status: deposit + mortgage agreement in principle
- [ ] Buyer to instruct solicitor within 24–48 hours
- [ ] You instruct solicitor same day
- [ ] Memorandum of sale issued with correct details
- [ ] Agree a target timeline (exchange and completion targets)
- [ ] Book survey dates early (if buyer is mortgaged)

## C) Week-by-week momentum
- [ ] Weekly progress update between agent, buyer, solicitors
- [ ] Respond to solicitor enquiries within 24–48 hours
- [ ] Provide documents immediately when requested
- [ ] Keep your phone reachable for quick decisions

## D) Survey and renegotiation (handle it the right way)
- [ ] Expect the survey to flag something (especially older homes)
- [ ] Ask for evidence, not just “survey says…”
- [ ] Get quotes for any real issues (one quote is rarely enough)
- [ ] If you concede, tie it to speed/certainty (e.g., “price reduction if exchange by…”)
- [ ] Keep emotions out of it — focus on keeping the deal alive

## E) Chain management essentials
- [ ] Confirm the chain length (how many links)
- [ ] Identify the “weakest link” early (unsecured buyer, slow solicitor, etc.)
- [ ] Set realistic completion dates (avoid guessing)
- [ ] Keep a plan B if the chain wobbles (alternate property / temporary move)

## F) Prevent buyer cold feet
- [ ] Keep the home presentable until exchange
- [ ] Be flexible on reasonable access (survey/valuation visits)
- [ ] Avoid long gaps with no updates
- [ ] Don’t overload buyers with extra negotiations late on

## G) Final week to completion
- [ ] Confirm removals booked
- [ ] Meter readings plan
- [ ] Keys handover plan confirmed with the agent
- [ ] Keep essentials separate (documents, meds, chargers)
