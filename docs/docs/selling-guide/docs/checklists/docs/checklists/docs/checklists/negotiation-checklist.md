# Offer Negotiation Checklist (Aberdare / CF44)

A good offer is not just the number — it’s certainty, speed, and fewer surprises.

## A) Before you respond to any offer
Capture the details:
- [ ] Offer amount: £______
- [ ] Buyer type: first-time / chain / investor / relocating
- [ ] Deposit amount: £______
- [ ] Mortgage agreed in principle: yes / no
- [ ] Buyer needs to sell? yes / no (how far along?)
- [ ] Proposed timescale: ____ weeks
- [ ] Any conditions: subject to survey / subject to sale / fixtures included, etc.

## B) Strength check (ask your agent to confirm)
- [ ] Proof of deposit seen
- [ ] Mortgage broker/lender details confirmed
- [ ] Buyer’s property (if any) is on market / SSTC / sold
- [ ] Buyer has solicitor ready (or will appoint within 48 hours)
- [ ] Buyer understands what’s included (fixtures/fittings)

## C) Your priorities (decide upfront)
Rank these 1–5:
- [ ] Highest price
- [ ] Fastest completion
- [ ] Least risk of fall-through
- [ ] Flexibility on move dates
- [ ] Minimal renegotiation later

## D) How to handle low offers (without killing the deal)
- [ ] Respond quickly (same day if possible)
- [ ] Counter with a clear number and reasoning (comparables + demand)
- [ ] Offer a “middle ground” if the buyer is strong
- [ ] Use a deadline if needed (“We’ll review all offers by…”)

## E) If you accept an offer
Confirm in writing:
- [ ] Agreed price
- [ ] What’s included (appliances, sheds, wardrobes, etc.)
- [ ] Target exchange date
- [ ] Target completion date
- [ ] Next steps and who is doing what

## F) Reduce renegotiation risk (common traps)
- [ ] Be realistic about survey outcomes (older terraces often flag damp/roof)
- [ ] If you already know an issue, disclose it early
- [ ] Consider getting small fixes done pre-survey (guttering, obvious leaks)
- [ ] Keep paperwork ready (FENSA, guarantees, building regs)

## G) Backup plan (protect yourself)
- [ ] Keep a short “reserve list” of interested viewers
- [ ] Ask your agent about continuing marketing until solicitor instructed
- [ ] Agree a point where you’ll relaunch if progress stalls
